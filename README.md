# CP1404 Assignment 1 - Song List 1.0

Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP5632, IT@JCU

By: _HuayuZhong_

This repo contains starter files including a Python file and two CSV files.  
`songs.csv` is a data file for you to use.  
`songs_backup.csv` is the same data, but not to be used... it is here as a backup to copy the data from if you need it
again.

Edit this README file, replacing the instructions (including this paragraph) with your own assignment details.  
At the end of the project, complete the very brief project reflection below by answering the questions (replace
the `answer...` parts).

1. How long did the entire project (assignment 1) take you?

   > 3 hours

2. What do you plan to do differently in your development process for assignment 2?

   > For my next assignment, I aim to focus on thorough planning and requirement analysis before starting to code, improve code quality by using advanced Python features and best practices, enhance testing and debugging processes, manage my time more efficiently and maintain better documentation and version control. Additionally, I'll actively seek feedback and regularly evaluate my progress and the quality of my work.
