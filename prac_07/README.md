# CP1404 Practicals Repository

Welcome to my repository for the CP1404 - Programming II practicals. This repository contains the practical tasks and projects I've completed as part of the course.

## About Me

I'm [HuayuZhong], a student at [JCU] studying [IT]. I'm passionate about software development and eager to learn best practices in coding.

## Lessons Learned

- **Readability is Essential**: Writing code that is easy to read and understand is crucial for collaboration and maintenance.
- **Refactoring**: Regularly refactoring code can help to identify and reduce complexity, making it more efficient and easier to manage.
- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Using clear and consistent naming for variables, functions, and classes makes the code more intuitive and easier to follow.
