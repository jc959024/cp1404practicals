# Practical 10
## Task Estimation Accuracy
When it comes to estimating practical tasks, my accuracy started off below par. 
I frequently underestimated the time required for coding tasks. 
However, as the course progressed, I honed my ability to break down tasks more effectively, resulting in a noticeable improvement in my estimation accuracy. 
This learning experience was invaluable in making me more pragmatic in my project planning.
## Code Reviews
The role of code reviews in shaping my development as a programmer cannot be overstated. 
Being subjected to code reviews provided me with invaluable insights into best practices, enriched my coding style, and instilled in me the art of crafting more maintainable code. 
My active involvement in code reviews also taught me how to deliver constructive feedback, fostering a culture of collaboration and a constant pursuit of enhancement within the team.

## Subject Improvements
If I were responsible for the course, I would consider implementing the following changes to enhance the overall learning experience:

Infusing practical tasks with real-world scenarios to replicate challenges encountered in professional development.
Offering workshops or supplementary resources on advanced topics, granting students the opportunity to delve deeper into areas of personal interest.
Promoting more collaborative projects to cultivate teamwork and communication skills.
Providing regular platforms for students to showcase their work to peers, thus refining their presentation and communication proficiencies.

Here are two examples of my code reviews from past practicals:
